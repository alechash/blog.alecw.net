Note, we won't actually talk about Netflix in this because at the moment, they aren't nearly as powerful as any of the other companies or in as many markets as the others.


# How Most People Currently View Them

### Facebook

A nice digital company that connects friends and families to eachother across the internet. A website owned by a giant tech company making cool initiatives and goals as well as products.

### Amazon

A digital retailer helping small businesses bring their products and stores to the internet. A website owned by someone that will keep it running for years on end.

### Apple

A luxury tech brand. A brand that makes good looking software and hardware compared to competitors. A company that makes an ecosystem of products and makes them easily connectable and usable.

### Google

A company bringing meriads of digital informaton to our finger tips. A comapny bringing free software and products to billions of people with no clear benefit to Google.

# How People Should View These Companies

### Facebook

A social media firm that analyzes thousands upon thousands of images of your children, activates your phone as a listening device, and sells this information to fortune 500 companies.

### Amazon

A retailer that refuses to pay sales tax, treats its employees poorly, destroys hundreds of thousands of jobs, and yet is celebrated as a paragon of business innovation.

### Apple

A computer company that withholds information about a domestic act of terrorism from federal investigators, with the support of a fan following that views the firm similar to a religion.

### Google

An ad platform that commands, in some markets, a 90 percent share of the most lucrative sector in media, yet avoids anticompetitive regulation through aggressive litigation and lobbyists.
