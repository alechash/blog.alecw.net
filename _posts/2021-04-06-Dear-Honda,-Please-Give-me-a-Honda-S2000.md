# Are you even into cars?

I am normally not into cars, like really, I've never been into cars before. But when I saw this car for the first time, something clicked, like I just loved it.

# Why do you like this car?

There are a lot of things I love about this car, I've put it into a list because it is a lot.

* big hood -- I like longer hoods, usually seen on convertibles
* convertible -- they feel nice on the highway and backroads (and when its hot out)
* its manual -- listen, automatics are fine but manuals are my stuff, they are just better
* Honda -- its a reliable Japanese car company
* RWD -- easier to say, drift, than front wheel drive
* gas mileage -- although ~20 mpg isn't the best, it is pretty good for a track car
* 2003 -- I like Hondas 1990-2010 cars more than their current cars

# Which one do you like?

Personally, I like the AP1 2003 three with a front bumper lip. If I were to tell you everything I want, here it is:

* AP1 2003 Model
* Red Body
* Black Sport Rims
* Black Interior
* RWD
* Manual Transmission
* Convertible
* Used -- Never Driven 18 year old car is bound to be $$$$

### Is there even a used car that fits all of these wants?

Yes, there actually is, it is 300 miles from were I live though and I just haven't had time to check it out. So, Honda if you want to buy this for me and send it to me, please do. ;).
