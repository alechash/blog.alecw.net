I"ê<p>By this time, I am sure you have heard of NodeTube. The, in my opinion, the best YouTube alternative. In this tutorial I am going to show you guys how you can set up a NodeTube instance in less than 10 minutes! As you can see in the image, NodeTube is easy to customize with dark mode, media views, and so much more!</p>

<p>I am working on a Mac so I am going to include some instructions that will make it easier for a Mac because I know them for MacOS but not for Windows/Linux. Although, it should still be easy to follow!</p>

<p>The link to the GitHub repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube">mayeaux/nodetube</a></p>

<h1 id="installing-software">Installing Software</h1>

<p>Youâ€™ll want to have some software installed first!</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll want <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js 8.0+</a> installed. You can find all the downloads on that link for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</p>

<p>Once that is installed you can install <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass">MongoDB Community Edition</a> when installing that, make sure to install the Community Edition. Or you can brew install it on a Mac:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew tap mongodb/brew

<span class="c"># then</span>
brew <span class="nb">install </span>mongodb-community@4.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Youâ€™ll also want <a href="https://redis.io/download">Redis</a>, you can download it there.</p>

<p>Lastly, youâ€™ll want <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">ffmpeg</a> you can download it there!</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="running-software">Running Software</h1>

<p>To run the software youâ€™ll need to run these command:</p>

<p>to start Redis all you need to do is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis-server</code></p>

<p>to start MongoDB all you need is this:</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mongod

<span class="c"># or if you are on a mac</span>
brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To setup ffmpeg, you need to follow some instructions depending on your OS. Ivâ€™e included some link for <a href="https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/20495/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-ffmpeg-in-windows">Windows</a>, <a href="http://ericholsinger.com/install-ffmpeg-on-a-mac">MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/">Linux</a></p>

<hr />

<h1 id="running-nodetube">Running Nodetube</h1>

<p>First we want to clone the repository onto your computer</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube</code></p>

<p>cd into nodetube: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd nodetube</code></p>

<p>install node modules: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code></p>

<p>and fire it up: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm start</code></p>

<p>There, you have an instance running. But, lets customize it a little bit more!</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="customizing-nodetube">Customizing Nodetube</h1>

<p>As you can probably tell by all the different instances of NodeTube including <a href="http://newtube.app/">NewTube</a>, <a href="http://nullvideo.com/">NullVideo</a>, and <a href="https://vid8.poal.co/">Vid8</a>. There is a lot of customization that can be done!</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>

<p>All the needed Meta information is in .env.setting and .env.private. For example, the name, Stripe information (yes there is plus, which means you can make money off this!), and max rating (sfw, nsfw, sensitive).</p>

<h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

<p>Most of the CSS is stored in public/css/main.css. But there is also a lot of inline CSS in the code itself.</p>

<h3 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h3>

<p>Adding dark/light mode is very easy. All you have to do is insert that code into views/partials/header.pug under the styling!</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">/* Dark mode: */</span>
<span class="nt">body</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">footer</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#1a1a1c</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">darkgray</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Light mode: */</span>
<span class="nt">body</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">footer</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To turn dark mode on, just comment out the light mode code and vise versa!</p>

<h1 id="more-styling">More Styling</h1>

<p>There is so much more styling you can do! Not just what I showed you! I do have a branch on NodeTubeâ€™s repo for front end styling. It is full of new styling that isnâ€™t in the master branch, so if you want some tips or ideas on what you can do just check out that branch here: <a href="https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube/tree/front-end">mayeaux/nodetube#tree=front-end</a></p>
