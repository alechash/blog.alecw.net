<p>I am normally not into cars, like really, I’ve never been into cars before. But when I saw this car for the first time, something clicked, like I just loved it.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-you-like-this-car">Why do you like this car?</h1>

<p>There are a lot of things I love about this car, I’ve put it into a list because it is a lot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>big hood – I like longer hoods, usually seen on convertibles</li>
  <li>convertible – they feel nice on the highway and backroads (and when its hot out)</li>
  <li>its manual – listen, automatics are fine but manuals are my stuff, they are just better</li>
  <li>Honda – its a reliable Japanese car company</li>
  <li>RWD – easier to say, drift, than front wheel drive</li>
  <li>gas mileage – although ~20 mpg isn’t the best, it is pretty good for a track car</li>
  <li>2003 – I like Hondas 1990-2010 cars more than their current cars</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="which-one-do-you-like">Which one do you like?</h1>

<p>Personally, I like the AP1 2003 three with a front bumper lip. If I were to tell you everything I want, here it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1 2003 Model</li>
  <li>Red Body</li>
  <li>Black Sport Rims</li>
  <li>Black Interior</li>
  <li>RWD</li>
  <li>Manual Transmission</li>
  <li>Convertible</li>
  <li>Used – Never Driven 18 year old car is bound to be \(\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="is-there-even-a-used-car-that-fits-all-of-these-wants">Is there even a used car that fits all of these wants?</h3>

<p>Yes, there actually is, it is 300 miles from were I live though and I just haven’t had time to check it out. So, Honda if you want to buy this for me and send it to me, please do. ;).
