I"J<p>i like crypto currency, dont get me wrong, its cool. i think it is the future, but for now, imma jump on the hype train and make jokes along the journey. i actually invested in cryptocurrency a while ago, still hodling.</p>

<h1 id="doge">doge</h1>

<p>I like dogecoin for a reason, it is different. Like someone said, it is a middlefinger to the investors. This is why I specifically like it, its funny. Like wo doesn’t like “Shibatoshi, Nakamoto”? Thats awesome.</p>

<p>Crypto is not something I would heavily invest in, in fact, I have more in the US stock market than in crypto (but i do have a lot of dogecoin). Crypto is bipolar, yes, i know it is genuine and real, but, it is so freaking bipolar. I invested early on in Doge. When it hit 50c, I was so happy. Two days later, it was at 70c, which was insane. I thought about selling, but, I realized this is a long term investment and not a short term, so I kept hodling.</p>

<p>Then, literally 10 hours later, it is like at 30c. I was still happy though because this is considerably higher than what i bought in at.</p>

<p>I don’t really know where I am going with this article, but remember:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is not a pyramid scheme</li>
  <li>it is risky</li>
  <li>buy early</li>
  <li>dont check prices</li>
  <li>much wow</li>
</ul>

<p>mcuh wow, very currency… goodbye</p>
