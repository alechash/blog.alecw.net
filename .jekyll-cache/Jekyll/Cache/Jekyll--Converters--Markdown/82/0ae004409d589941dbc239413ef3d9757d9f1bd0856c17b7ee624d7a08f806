I"é<p>So, long story short, it only took me 34 minutes to not only reverse engineer Gettrsâ€™ API, but also abuse it and get rate-limited.</p>

<p>It wasnt that hard, what surprised me more though is the lack of a ratelimit. I created ~1000 posts in 1 minute and 30 seconds.</p>

<p>BUT, guess what? It wasnâ€™t even an API ratelimit, it was a CloudFlare ratelimit.</p>

<p>You can see the ~1000 posts in the gif below.</p>
