                "Apps like Facebook and Twitter get you sucked in by showing simple metrics like how many comments there are or how many likes there are. All of these simple, but useless, stats just keep sucking you into clicking more and more stuff.",
                "Like I said, showing the amount of comments will encourage you to click the little icon and read some. Reddit noticed this, they know there website is based around comments. So, what did they do? They put ads in the comments. Twitter has also done this.",
                "subhead:People dont realize there addiction",
                "This isnt \"as a programmer\" opinion, but more in life in general, people just dont realize there addiction to there phones, it is ridiculous. For example, I'll be over at someones house after an invite and all they might do is be on there phone. They usually periodically say, \"Hey, look at this.\" then show me there phone. And I am just sitting there pretending to be entertained by my phone so they or I dont feel weird sitting there.",
                "Someone might spend 6 hours on there phone a day and not realize it. The only thing phones should be used for is, making calls, answering emails, texting people, checking stocks/crypto, and other simple entertainment. But, browsing Instagram for 3 hours does you absolutely no good.",
